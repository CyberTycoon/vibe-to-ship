# vibe-to-ship loop — single dispatcher for the 5-beat loop.
# Each beat is one command. The loop is the discipline; this script is the reminder.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/loop.sh [boot|triage|act|verify|learn]
#   boot    verify the environment is ready (delegates to doctor.sh)
#   triage  reality check before planning (delegates to triage.sh)
#   act     print the bounded-task contract, then hand off to the agent
#   verify  compare reality against the plan (delegates to verify.sh)
#   learn   append a session summary block to MEMORY.md (or stdout if absent)
#
# Exit codes: 0 = beat passed, 1 = beat failed (verify/boot), 2 = bad usage.
